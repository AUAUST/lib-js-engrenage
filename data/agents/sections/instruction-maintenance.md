## Instruction maintenance

- Never modify AGENTS.md or `.claude/rules/` unless the user explicitly asks to change agent instructions. Finishing a feature, refactor or new convention does not authorize it; mention the suggested change in your report instead.
- A `<!-- @reference <reference> -->` marker opens a block that `engrenage sync agents` fills with the referenced file, up to the next `@reference` or `<!-- @end -->` marker. Never edit blocks in place: add project rules after an `@end` marker, or change the referenced source.
- AGENTS.md holds only rules every agent needs. Surface-specific detail lives in `.claude/rules/`, one file per surface. Neither holds feature documentation, file inventories, API details or records of recent changes.
- When a rule becomes mechanically enforced, remove its prose. List it under the matching "Enforced by tooling" line only when its fix is not automatic and it shapes how code is first written; autofixed formatting and layout rules need no entry.
