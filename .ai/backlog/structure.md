# structure

Project structure description, its report and the tooling generated from it.

## 1. `engrenage structure` prints text only (#156), not machine-readable data.

- why: editor integrations would need it as data.
- want: a `--json` flag printing the resolved structure with each directory's classification and source.
- done: a consumer needs it and the flag exists.
